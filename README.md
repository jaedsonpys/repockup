# Repockup

Clone all your repositories (including private ones) with `Repockup` quickly and simply!

**Repockup** stores information about that repository on the first run of the script, and only clones it again if the repository has changed.

Install `Repockup` using setuptools:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

# Using Repockup

To clone all your repositories, use the `backup` command with a few arguments:

- `--username`: Target profile username on GitHub (without "@");
- `--api-token`: If you want to clone your public repositories as well, you need to add a token generated by GitHub and put it here;
- `--dest`: Destination directory of the ZIP file containing the repositories.

A command to clone my public repositories would look like this:

```
repockup backup --username jaedsonpys --dest ./
```

A `repockup.json` file will be created in your default user directory, so when you back up again, only the repositories that have changed will be cloned.
